Hello! Welcome on this GitHub Page! So here you can take a look at my code, suggest improvements or anything. I don't have any problem with the fact that you inspire yourself from my code, but please don't copy it. 
Also it's useless to try to do it yourself and unlock the limit since that you need the API key to do requests. You can get your own API key of course but you'll have to pay for each request you do, so let me pay for you at this point.

I don't have much more to say, feel free to visit the support server to give me your feedbacks, it's always appreciated!
